                <p>Rating: 5.0</p>
                <p>This is one of the first and best Korean chicken store I've ever tried. Prices are reasonable and their chicken is so delicious. I always order Half and half chicken so that I can have two flavors in one. And it comes with free chopsticks! I highly recommend their Yangnyeom and Jack Daniels ðŸ’¯ Highly recommended!!</p>

                <p>Rating: 4.2</p>
                <p>We've dined at Robinson Magnolia and at Fishermall branch and done some takeout also here in Banaue... so love their value meals ranging from 100-150P with iced tea already. Tasty food from pancit to fried chicken to crispy patatim... I also noticed some of the restaurant history framed on the wall; it was a nice touch!</p>

                <p>The place is old and not properly maintained, especially the washroom. The food looks unappealing...it's very different from the photo above the cashier.</p>

                <p>Rating: 3.2</p>
                <p>Slow in the morning. This is what I notice about them. Counter Service is slow in the morning. The dispatch and busting is fine. Just the counter staff. I love Jollibee, but I guess running a store for 24 hours takes its toll on the early morning shift.</p>

                <p>Cozy nook in the middle of the busy university belt! As much as I'd want to gatekeep this place, I won't because it provides people the experience of a conducive environment, friendly company, and most of all, pour over coffee!</p>
